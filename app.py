# Requirements
# It is a CLI-based game, so you need to use the command line to interact with the game. The game should work as follows:
#
# When the game starts, it should display a welcome message along with the rules of the game.
# The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
# User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.
# The user should be able to enter their guess.
# If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
# If the user’s guess is incorrect, the game should display a message indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user’s guess.
# The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.
